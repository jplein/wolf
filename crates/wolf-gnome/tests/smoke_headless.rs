//! Opt-in, headless-compositor end-to-end smoke test for the real `wolf-gnome`
//! window.
//!
//! ## What it proves
//!
//! That the built `wolf-gnome` binary launches a real GTK/Adwaita window under a
//! headless Wayland compositor, attaches Neovim, accepts keyboard input, and
//! *actually renders glyphs* — verified by screenshotting the live window and
//! OCR-ing it. Unlike the Tier-1 seam tests (which exercise `gdk_key`/`paint`
//! offscreen), this is the only test that confirms the whole stack draws a window
//! a human could see.
//!
//! ## Why it is `#[ignore]` (opt-in)
//!
//! It needs a compositor + a screenshot/OCR toolchain that a normal `cargo test`
//! run (and most CI lanes) will not have, so it is ignored by default. Run it
//! explicitly:
//!
//! ```text
//! nix develop --command cargo test -p wolf-gnome -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! ## Requirements (all provided by the flake devShell's smoke toolchain)
//!
//! - `cage` (headless wlroots compositor), `wtype`, `grim`, `tesseract` on `PATH`.
//! - `WOLF_NVIM_BIN` pointing at the pinned Neovim (same contract as the other
//!   wolf-gnome tests; nvim is never taken from `PATH`).
//! - `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` set and writable (the Wayland socket lives there).
//!
//! Per project policy we FAIL LOUD if any of the above is missing rather than
//! silently skipping, mirroring `common::require_nvim_bin` — a missing
//! precondition means the smoke toolchain was not provisioned, which is a setup
//! bug we want surfaced, not hidden. (NOTE to coder: the compositor tools come
//! from the flake, so a hard fail is intentional even for the "optional"-looking
//! binaries; do not soften this to a skip without revisiting the plan.)

// Keyboard-navigation picker smoke (Up/Down move the list selection).
//
// This scenario proves arrow-key navigation: with TWO files both matching the
// query, pressing `Down` once moves the list selection to the SECOND row, and
// `Enter` then opens THAT row (not the top one).
//
// Deterministic row order (no MRU yet, so order is purely the rank function):
// both files are created fresh in the temp cwd, so neither is in the MRU cache —
// `mru_group`/`mru_rank` tie. With query `pick`, the matched span is the literal
// prefix `pick` of the single filename word (`pick1` / `pick2` — the filename is
// split on `.` so the word before the extension is `pick1` / `pick2`). For both:
//   - prefix_group: `pick` is a strict prefix of the word => tie (0)
//   - word_index: matched word is the first/only word => tie (0)
//   - match_start: 0 => tie
//   - span: `pick` is contiguous, last-first => tie
//   - display.len: `pick1.md` and `pick2.md` are equal length => tie
//   - display lexicographic: `pick1.md` < `pick2.md` => `pick1.md` is ROW 0,
//     `pick2.md` is ROW 1.
// So Down (one step) selects row 1 = `pick2.md`, whose heading is `# PICKTWO`;
// OCR must then contain `picktwo`. We also (loosely) assert OCR does NOT contain
// `pickone`, proving the selection actually moved off the top row.
//
// NOTE to coder: this relies on (a) the rank tiebreaks resolving these two equal
// matches by display length then lexicographically (so `pick1.md` is row 0), and
// (b) `Down` moving the LIST/ListBox selection rather than the SearchEntry text
// cursor. If either assumption is wrong the OCR assertion (`picktwo`) will fail —
// verify both against the picker implementation.

// Tree-sidebar population smoke (the left-hand file tree lists cwd files).
//
// This scenario proves the S3 tree sidebar POPULATES from the same FileSearch
// mechanism as the picker: a distinctively-named markdown file dropped into the
// app's cwd must appear (by FILENAME) in the left-hand tree, with no picker
// interaction at all. We assert ONLY that the filename text renders in the
// window (loose OCR contains), which demonstrates the long-lived FileSearch fed
// the tree projection (`children_of`) and the ListView drew the row.
//
// NOTE to coder: this asserts tree POPULATION only (the filename is visible in
// the sidebar). Single-click-to-open and the current-file highlight/reveal are
// NOT verified here — they are covered by S1 (current_file core tests), S2 +
// `rel_path_for` pure unit tests, and manual/visual checking, because OCR cannot
// reliably confirm a highlight color and we deliberately avoid pixel-accurate
// row clicking (too flaky — the architect explicitly avoids it).
//
// NOTE to coder: adding the gtk::Paned + tree ListView to the left of the editor
// MUST NOT break the existing `window_renders_typed_text_under_cage` and
// `picker_*_under_cage` OCR assertions — the editor must still render its glyphs
// (OCR_WORD / PICKER_OCR) in the right-hand pane. Verify those three smokes still
// pass after wiring the Paned (e.g. give the editor pane adequate width).
